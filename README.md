# Docker with Anonymous and Named Volumes as well as Bind Mounts

This project demonstrates the use of different types of Docker volumes:

- **Anonymous Volumes**: Temporary volumes that are not explicitly named.
- **Named Volumes**: Volumes with explicit names, allowing for reuse across containers.
- **Bind Mounts**: Mounts that map directories on the host to paths inside the container.
